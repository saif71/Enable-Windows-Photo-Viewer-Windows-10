Bring back best old windows photos and fax viewer in Windows 10

### How to get Windows Photo Viewer back in Windows 10 (Home / Pro / Education)
Windows 10 has a bunch of new apps, including a new **Photos app**. I HATE the Photos app, it sucks.
Slow & sluggish as hell. Here is the solution to bring back old Windows Photo Viewer.

 ### If upgraded from Windows 7, 8 or 8.1

simply open up  **Settings**  and go to  **System > Default apps**. Under "Photo viewer," you should see your current default photo viewer (probably the new Photos app). Click this to see a list of options for a new default photo viewer. Assuming you upgraded to Windows 10 from a previous version of Windows, you should see Windows Photo Viewer as an option.

Choose Windows Photo Viewer and exit the Settings menu, and you're done

 ### If installed Windows 10 from scratch
 
 1. Clone or Download this repository
